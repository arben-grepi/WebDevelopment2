The error message indicates that you are trying to remove containers that are still running. You need to stop the containers first before removing them. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Stop all running containers:

   `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`

2. Then, remove all containers:

   `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`

If you want to force remove the running containers without stopping them first, you can use the -f (force) flag:

`docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)`

This command will stop and remove all containers in one go.
