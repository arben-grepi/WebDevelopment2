## tehtävä2

This project is a language translation application that enables users to add Finnish words along with their English translations and retrieve English equivalents by entering Finnish words. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can seamlessly navigate between adding new words and searching for existing ones. It serves as a practical tool for language learners, providing an efficient way to expand vocabulary and improve language skills.

The client is built with **React** and **Vite** for a fast and responsive user experience, while the backend is developed using **Node.js**. The application uses **Document** as a proxy for the database, facilitating smooth data management and retrieval.
